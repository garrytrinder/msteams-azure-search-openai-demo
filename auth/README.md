# ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search in Microsoft Teams (No Authentication)

This sample app demonstrates how to use a Microsoft Teams bot to chat with your data using natural language in the flow of work.

It builds on top of the [ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) sample.

- [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io), are an open card exchange format enabling developers to exchange UI content in a common and consistent way.
- [Azurite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azurite), provides emulation for Azure Storage during development.
