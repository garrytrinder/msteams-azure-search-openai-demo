# ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search in Microsoft Teams

This sample app demonstrates how to use a Microsoft Teams bot to chat with your data using natural language in the flow of work.

It builds on top of the [ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) sample.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This sample has been tested against the 19th January 2024 [commit](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/tree/5e9d142e50a624cd70e42c4c654097e2fb646d36) in the `Azure Search OpenAI Demo` repo

- [Teams AI Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-ai), provides a Microsoft Teams centric approach to building bots.
- [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io), are an open card exchange format enabling developers to exchange UI content in a common and consistent way.
- [Azurite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azurite), provides emulation for Azure Storage during development.

## Prepare

To run this project, you will need to:

1. Follow the steps to deploy the [ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo#getting-started) sample to Azure.
1. Install Teams Toolkit from the extensions marketplace in VSCode.
1. Clone/fork this repo to your local machine.
1. Open the repo folder in VSCode.
1. In the `env/samples` folder, copy the sample files to the parent folder `env`
1. In the `env` folder, rename all files removing `.sample` from the name
1. In `.env.local`, update `APP_BACKEND_ENDPOINT` variable with the URL to your provisioned backend
1. In `.env.testtool`, update `APP_BACKEND_ENDPOINT` variable with the URL to your provisioned backend
1. In `.env.dev`, update `APP_BACKEND_ENDPOINT` variable with the URL to your provisioned backend

## Run against a simulated Microsoft 365 tenant and bot service

To run this sample:

> ![TIP]
> Use this approach if you don't have access to a Microsoft 365 tenant, are unable to use a Dev Tunnel, are unable to sideload apps into your tenant, or are unable provision Microsoft Entra ID or Bot Framework resources required to create a bot.

1. [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/dev/dev-proxy/get-started#install-dev-proxy) Dev Proxy on your local machine
